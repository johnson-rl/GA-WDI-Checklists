*Feel free to add or edit checklists to this repo.  By the end of the course we could have a full set of instructions for how to build all of apps we know how to build.  If you add a checklist, please push it to this repo and add a link to it on this readme.  The format to link to a readme will look like this:*
```
[Text to display on the page](link to the readme file)

For example, the rails link is:

[How to set up a rails app](https://github.com/johnson-rl/GA-WDI-Checklists/blob/master/Set-up-a-rails-app.md)
```

*Shout out to Zach for getting us started with this rails checklist!*
